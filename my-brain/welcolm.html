<h3>Frontal lobe</h3>

<p>What does the frontal lobe do?</p>

<div><a>The frontal lobe basically handles executive function.</a></div>

<p>Executive functions are when you do tasks that involve self-management and self-regulation.</p>

<p>I find I am really good at self-management. When I have a project, I need to get it done. The more tasks that are piled on top of me, the more I get done. I usually don&#39;t procrastinate and as a result, my work is done on time.</p>

<h3>Optic lobe</h3>

<p>What does the optic lobe do?</p>

<div><a>The optic lobe handles eyesight.</a> <a>In life, we use our eyes all the time. In order to do a lot of tasks, we have to see them. All people are different and so the way we perceive information is different.</a> <a>Throughout my time in public school, I found it hard or even impossible to do certain tasks because I did not see what my end was going to be.</a> <a>I&#39;m a visual learner which basically means that in order for me to do a task <b>in school</b> I have to see the end goal.</a></div>

<h3>Parietal lobe</h3>

<p>What does the parietal lobe do?</p>

<div><a>The parietal lobe handles sensory information.</a> <a>One way we as humans remember information is by using our four senses. Smelling helps us remember the past. If you smelled a cake baking you might remember your last birthday.</a> <a>For me, I remember lighting my first campfire on a camping trip at overnight camp.</a></div>

<div class="temporallobe" id="e">
<h3>Temporal lobe</h3>

<div>What does the temporal lobe?</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>the temporal lobe handles memory. There are lots of ways that we as humans recall memory.&nbsp; There are two ways that the brain remembers something; implicit (stuff you do without thinking) and explicit (stuff we have to continuously remember).&nbsp;<br />
For most people, it is easier to remember information when you speak it out loud. I find that going over my flash cars out loud is much better than doing them silently.&nbsp;<br />
It is also said that writing down your notes is better because it forces you to make changes. When you type you are just copying down exactly what you are being taught. Regardless of what studies show, I find that my spelling and handwriting are so bad that writing down information is less helpful. On the computer, I am actually slower than on paper, but, I use the computer more because I find that it is much easier to study and then recall what I typed.&nbsp;<br />
All of our brains are different so the ways that we handle information are different. No one way to study is correct; there are definitely better ways than others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div class="cerebellum" id="f">
<h3>Cerebellum</h3>

<p>What does the cerebellum do?</p>

<div><a>The cerebellum handles balance and also temperature control. I personally think that temperature is important. When I am cold I find that it is easier to sleep, so when I sleep well I can focus better. </a></div>
